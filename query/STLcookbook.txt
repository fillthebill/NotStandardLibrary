When used in a loop, the incremented iterator
 is compared against an end 
iterator, for which we need to define the != operator.
 We are only comparing the 
step at which the Fibonacci iterators currently reside,
 which makes it easier to define the end iterator for step
 1000000, for example, as we do not need to expensively
 calculate such a high Fibonacci number in advance

In order to be able to use the Fibonacci iterator
 in the range-based for loop, we 
have to implement a range class beforehand.
 We call it fib_range, and its
